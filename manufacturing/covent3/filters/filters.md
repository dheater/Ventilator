Enclosure
=========

======================

The ventilator enclosure is made up of three folded, 1.52mm thick, stainless steel sheets; the main enclosure, the rear
closure panel and the internal equipment bracket.

The main enclosure is folded from a single sheet and fastened together using ⅛ " diameter, stainless steel blind rivets
(McMaster 97525A420). There are rubber bumper feet (McMaster 9541K82) on the bottom of the enclosure that are threaded
into M6 PEM nuts (Bisco CLS-M6-1). The rubber bumpers can be removed to allow the enclosure to be mounted to a medical
cart. M4 PEM nuts are installed, on tabs, on the main enclosure to allow the rear closure panel to be fastened to the
main enclosure. ![](images/image17.png)

The rear closure panel is folded from a single sheet. The rear closure panel is fastened to the main enclosure using
(6) M4 x 0.7 x 6mm long, phillips, pan head, 18-8 stainless steel screws.

The internal equipment bracket is folded from a single sheet. The bracket is designed to be simple and lightweight.
Acrylic sheets are either fastened to or hung from the bracket to allow for design adjustments while utilizing the same
bracket. The internal equipment bracket is attached to the main enclosure using (6) M4 x 0.7 x 6mm long, phillips, pan
head, 18-8 stainless steel screws.

Fabrication drawings for the enclosure are provided in [Appendix 1](#h.yeca1qmgqup2).

In-Line Filter Housing
======================

The ventilator uses four mass-manufactured replaceable HEPA filter cartridges to isolate the patient from the device,
and to isolate the device gas path from the environment. These filters were selected based on research described in the
design overview document. Currently this form factor HEPA filter is available in quantities exceeding 10,000. A set of
custom panel-mount components houses this filter cartridge and serves as the connector for the inspiratory and
expiratory ends of the patient breathing circuit. A modified version of these connectors, utilizing the same filter,
is used as an additional barrier on the inspiratory and expiratory pathway to the device.

Tubing connector assembly, with side 22M tubing connector in dark blue, filter in light blue, and internal connector
shown in gray.

While the prototype components are 3D printed using SLA resin, these parts are designed to be injection molded in ABS,
and have undergone several iterations of feedback from a fabrication partner that specializes in injection molding. As
such, they have a draft angle of 2 degrees and uniform wall thickness to simplify mold-making.

These parts are modular in design: the fixed component of the filter housing can accommodate several sizes of flexible
tubing connections on the back side (options for ¾ in / 19mm ID, and 1 in / 25 mm ID). This allows the same part to be
used for all four filter housings, decreasing part cost by economies of scale and simplifying the assembly procedure.
The fixed panel-mount component includes two M4 press-in or heat-set threaded metal inserts to be used as a mounting
point for the filter cartridge hold-down parts.

The replaceable filter cartridges are held in place by one of two component options - for the device inlet and outlet,
a simple screw-down tab holds the filter in place; for the patient breathing circuit connectors, a 22mm cone (male) port
is provided to interface with standard 22mm socket (female) breathing circuits. The patient breathing circuit connector
cone is dimensioned according to [ISO 5356-1](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui%23iso:std:iso:5356:-1:ed-4:v1:en).
All screw-down components use M4 fasteners screwed into the threaded metal inserts on the panel-mount component.
