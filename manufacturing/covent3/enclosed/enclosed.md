These components are intended to be assembled into a rugged sheet metal enclosure for the final mechanical design. The
compact version of the ventilator assembly and packaging strategy has already gone through several iterations,
including an Alpha Build device which proved out the use of a detachable internal structure for ease of assembly.

The next iteration of this build will demonstrate the packaging in the production housing, which has been designed but
not yet constructed. Based on lessons learned from the Alpha Build prototyping process, the ventilator will use a
detachable internal assembly, to which all pneumatic components can be mounted and connected. This allows for 360
degree accessibility to components during initial assembly. When complete, this internal assembly is bolted into the
enclosure, and the enclosure is screwed shut. The top-rear positioning of the removable enclosure lid provides
access to components that will need routine maintenance.

### Blower

Note that the check valve is not shown in the above setup but should be included with any build where oxygen is used.
The check valve is visible in blue in the image below.
