General Assembly Approach</h1>
<p>The ventilator system is designed such that the internal pneumatic assembly can be almost entirely completed with the system removed from the enclosure. This has proved useful during prototyping, because it allows nearly 360 degree access to the components which enables a compact arrangement of components that is otherwise difficult to achieve. To accomplish this, the front panels of the ventilator are mounted to a light internal structure for assembly of the pneumatic system. The final step of assembly is to mount this internal structure into the enclosure, connect the wiring for the enclosure cooling fan, and seal the enclosure.</p>
<p>The design basis for the functional-critical components of the pneumatic system are called out above in the <a href="../pneumatic-system">Pneumatic Design</a> section. When selecting the remaining components (e.g. plumbing fittings, tubing), the guiding principle was to select components that are widely available, so as to avoid constrained supply chains. Therefore, rigid plumbing connections use NPT standard fittings and connectors, usually in PVC plastic, and most connections between components are made using flexible plastic tubing and hose barb and clamp terminations. The determination to use the NPT standard is based on reports from our manufacturing partners in India and Guatemala, which indicated that NPT components are commonly available in both markets, as well as in the US where most of our prototyping activities take place. Additionally, these connections are sized such that either Â¾" ID tubing or 19mm ID tubing can be used, allowing for flexibility in use of metric or imperial components according to availability. In all other cases (e.g. fasteners, stock thicknesses, custom part dimensioning), metric components are used, due to their broader availability globally.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md28"></a>
Enclosure</h1>
<p>The following requirements drive the design of the ventilator system enclosure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must be sterilizable</li>
<li>Must be manufacturable with commonly available fabrication equipment in the markets we are assessing</li>
<li>Enclosed to protect the internals and keep out dust, liquid splashes, and fingers</li>
<li>Has an external fan (with dust filter) for cooling the internal electronics, sufficient to provide cooling even in unconditioned outdoor environments in emergency use cases</li>
<li>Ruggedized and compatible with the hospital environment, including capacity to mount on a rolling cart</li>
<li>Must support easy assembly and maintenance of the internal components</li>
<li>Acoustic damping to minimize auditory disruption of the machine</li>
</ul>
<p>The current concept uses basic sheet metal folding processes, which are widely available globally. Design details of this assembly can be found in 05-01 Production Methods for Custom Components.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md29"></a>
Maintenance</h1>
<p>Several components have known lifetimes that necessitate periodic replacement, specifically, filter cartridges, pinch valve tubing, and the O2 sensor.</p>
<p>Filter cartridges should at minimum be changed between patients. Further testing will determine whether more regular changes should be carried out, especially for the filters that separate the patient breathing circuit from the ventilator device. Because this is a frequent requirement, the filters are positioned on the front panel of the ventilator with easily accessible screw-down connections. The plastic hold-down components can be quickly removed, wiped down with disinfectant, and a new filter cartridge can be swapped in.</p>
<p>The pinch valve tubing is designed for peristaltic pumps, and is therefore rated for a high number of cycles. However, it has a lifetime shorter than the intended life of the ventilator, likely losing performance after several weeks of use, and therefore will need to be periodically replaced. To enable this, the pinch valves are positioned in the pneumatic assembly such that they are directly accessible by way of removing the back cover plate of the enclosure. This enables replacement of the tubing with minimal disassembly of the device.</p>
<p>Similarly, the oxygen sensor currently specified has a lifetime shorter than the design life of the ventilator device as a whole. It also is positioned in the ventilator internal assembly such that it is accessible for replacement. </p>
