<div class="textblock"><p>This document will track desired characterization tests and link to the corresponding data when the test is performed. Eventually the info from this document will likely be formalized into a record of tests that have been performed as part of the development and validation of the ventilator - integration tests with the real software are expected to be defined elsewhere, though they could be folded into this.</p>
<p><b>Caution:</b> this document has not been formally reviewed and is a work in progress. Be responsible to understand the provenance of documentation.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> these tests are supposed to be iteratively developed. As we progress, the tests will become more granular.</p>

<li>From PIPs from 20 cm H20 up to 60 cm H20 (or however high can be achieved, in reasonable increments), how quickly can the system vent down to PEEPs of 0 to 20 cm H20 (testing reasonable increments)?</li>
<li>For PIPs from 20 cm H20 up to 60 cm H20 (in reasonable increments), what is the maximum flow rate into the patient that can be achieved? How does this change as a function of how much the exhaust valve is open?</li>
